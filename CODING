Use UTF-8 wherever possible, in both source code and generated files.
The notebook content files should always be UTF-8.
Do not include a UTF-8 BOM.

C++
--------------------
* Use Doxygen.
* Expand tabs to 4 spaces.
* Declare parts of a variable type together.
  This:
    QObject* something;
  Not this:
    QObject *something;
* Do not declare multiple variables on one line.
  This:
    QString* something;
  Not this:
    QString* something, else;
* Braces are on new lines, except in typdef structs.
* Keep lines reasonable short.
* Don't be afraid of the const.
* Declare source headers before library headers.
  This:
    #include "notebook.h"

    #include <QFile>
  Not this:
    #include <QFile>

    #include "notebook.h"
* Use `this->` to indicate that a variable is a member.  Decorating member variables is *ugly*.
  This:
    this->something
  Not this:
    m_something
* Use get and set prefixes for properties.  It was a mistake for Qt to omit the `get` prefixes.
  This:
    const QString& getName() const;
  Not this:
    const QString& name() const;
* Avoid hungarian prefix crap, except for UI controls.

Javascript
--------------------
* Use Doxygen.
* Expand tabs to 4 spaces.
* Place braces on the same line, not a new line.
* Write cross-browser code, if possible.  Don't bother writing code to work on
  IE - just try to get it to work on Webkit, Gecko, and Opera.
* Make use of the JavaScript libraries/frameworks (Prototype JS).
* Use unobtrusive JavaScript.
