PepperNote builds on g++ and MinGW.  It will not build in VC2010 without
modification because it makes use of the C++11 range-based for loops.

Build Dependencies:
* Qt SDK (4.8)
** QtWebkit

The easiest way to build PepperNote is to build it from Qt Creator.

To build PepperNote from command line:
qmake /path/to/PepperNote/src
make -j4
