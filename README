PepperNote is a cross-platform note-taking software written in C++/Qt.

PepperNote is currently in development and has limited features... but aspires
to be a fully-featured note-taking program.

A notebook is organized into this structure:
* Notebook (an indivual file)
** Notebook section
*** Notebook pages

Notebook pages are HTML files.

PepperNote does not create registry keys.  Even in Windows, it uses the INI
format for saving settings.
Files generated by PepperNote:
* Settings files ($HOME/.config/PepperNote; %APPDATA% in Windows?)
* PepperNote notebooks ($HOME/Documents/PepperNote%20Notebooks;
  %USERPROFILE%/Documents/PepperNote%20Notebooks in Windows?)

Existing features:
* Multiple pages
* Formatted editing (bold, lists, etc)

  You can hand-edit the manifest to add or remove sections
